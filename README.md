When all tests succeed on Travis CI, the application is deployed to Heroku. Click the badges for detailed info. <br>
The uptime of the deployed applications can be tracked [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/pg2gDuQZQ). <br>
Errors that occur while using the deployed master branch on Heroku are logged to the [Errbit](http://swt2-errbit-2016.herokuapp.com/) error catcher, you can sign in with your Github account.

## Local Setup

* `bundle install` Install the required Ruby gem dependencies defined in the [Gemfile](https://github.com/hpi-swt2/workshop-portal/blob/master/Gemfile)
* `cp database.sqlite.yml database.yml` Select database config (for development we recommend SQLite) 
* `rake db:create db:migrate db:seed` Setup database, run migrations, seed the database with defaults
* `rails s` Start the Rails development server (By default runs on _localhost:3000_)
* `rspec` Run all the tests (using the [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) test framework)

## Setup using Vagrant (Virtual Machine)

If you want to use a VM to setup the project (e.g. when on Windows), we recommend [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
Please keep in mind that this method may lead to a loss in performance, due to the added abstraction layer.

```
vagrant up # bring up the VM
vagrant ssh # login using SSH
cd hpi-swt2
echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc # disable docs for gems
bundle install # install dependencies
gem install pg # required for Postgres usage
cp config/database.psql.yml config/database.yml # in case you want to use Postgres
cp config/database.sqlite.yml config/database.yml # in case you want to user SQLite
exit # restart the session, required step
vagrant ssh # reconnect to the VM
cd hpi-swt2
rails s -b 0 # start the rails server
# the -b part is necessary since the app is running in a VM and would
# otherwise drop the requests coming from the host OS
```

## Important Development Commands
* `bundle exec <command>` Run command within the context of the current gemset
* `rspec spec/controller/expenses_controller_spec.rb` Specify a folder or test file to run
* `rails c` Run the Rails console
* `rails c --sandbox` Test out some code without changing any data
* `rails g migration DoSomething` Create migration _db/migrate/*_DoSomething.rb_.
* `rails dbconsole` Starts the CLI of the database you're using
* `rake routes` Show all the routes (and their names) of the application
* `rails assets:precompile` Precompile the assets in app/assets to public/assets
* `rake about` Show stats on current Rails installation, including version numbers
* `rspec --profile` examine how much time individual tests take
